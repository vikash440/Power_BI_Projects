Problem: To find the area of focus for the Pakistan Young Hindu Forum (PYHF) for the 2023 calendar year.

Description: Pakistan Young Hindu Forum is an NGO which works mainly for poverty alleviation for the Hindus of Pakistan. In this report, 
             I have provided details of population distribution district-wise and area of interest in a populated region.  
             

Results:  -> More than 90% of the Hindu population lives in Sindh province.
          -> Around 9 lac population of Hindus reside in Mirpurkhas Division which encompasses Islamkot, Mithi and Mirpurkhas city. 
          -> Most NGOs in the MirpurKhas region work for a blood donation drive and Domestic Violence. 

Recommendations:  -> This report shows that majority of the region of the Mirpukhas division is deprived of focussed educational NGOs. It is highly recommended that PYHF 
                     should divert their funds related to education facilities, e.g. providing merit scholarships and global exposure.
