Problem: To find the feasibility of Air to Water Generator at different locations in Pakistan 

Description: Air to Water Generator mainly depends on the dew point, humidity and Temperature.
             To satisfy the criteria:
             -> More than 80% of days in the whole calendar year should have more than 20% humidity.
             -> Dew Point temperature should be more than 15*C to work at 80% efficiency.
             -> Rainy days are excluded as the humidity will always be greater than 20% on rainy days.
             

Results:  -> In Karachi and Lahore, more than 65% of days have Dew Point Temperature greater than 15*C
          -> All three cities have a humidity of greater than 20% on more than 90% of days.
          -> In Islamabad, the dew point temperature is less than 15*C on more than 70% of the days.

Recommendations:  -> Karachi and Lahore have almost similar data patterns, and both have shown significant output for the first trial. 
                     However, Islamabad has less dew point temperature on the majority of days. Therefore, Air to Water Generator will not work to its recommended efficiency.
